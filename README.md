# Stock optimiser
This Python calculator is designed to provide comprehensive analysis and performance optimisation of investment portfolios.

## Overview
The program is structured into the following five parts:
1. **Data Input and Retrieval:** 
   - Gathers user input for stock selections and fetches up-to-date data from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Portfolio Performance Analysis:**
   - Computes various performance metrics using technical financial theories.
   - Contrasts the portfolio's performance against the benchmark index.

3. **Portfolio Optimisation:**
   - Utilises portfolio optimisation techniques to maximise returns while considering user-defined constraints.

4. **Value at Risk (VaR) Calculation:**
   - Executes Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the potential maximum loss (Value at Risk) over a specified time horizon.
   - Provides insights into the portfolio's risk exposure in terms of probabilities.

5. **Graphical Illustrations:**
   - Generates graphical visualisations of key metrics, including cumulative returns, VaR distributions, and Sharpe ratio plots.

## Specifics
**Default settings:**
- DEFAULT_YEARS = "Retrieves the last 5 years of stock data"
- benchmark = "US Total Market Index, representing nearly 100% of the weighted average investable U.S. stock market"
- rf_rate_ticker = "Current 10-year US treasury rate"
- rf_rate = "None"
- region = "US"
- regex = "The regular expression for US ticker symbols."

**Command-line arguments:** By default, the program analyses stock data spanning the past five years, striking a balance between historical context and recent trends. However, users can specify the desired time horizon using command-line arguments when initiating the program.

**Customising benchmark values:** Advanced users can further customise the variables in the "Input class" to their desired benchmark portfolio, risk-free rate, and ticker input regex to their choice or for stock investments outside of the US.

**Logarithmic Returns:** The program employs logarithmic returns for accurate and robust rate of return calculations, ensuring precision in performance evaluation.

**Graphical Outputs:** Utilises the Matplotlib library to create graphical representations of portfolio metrics, improving visualisation and interpretation of results.


## Goal
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in writing a sophisticated portfolio analysis tool using Python, grounded in industry-standard financial theories and practices. Key goals include:
- **Practical and Precise Calculation:** The program provides practical yet precise calculations and logical implementations tailored for stock traders and investors.
- **Suitability for Long-Term Investment:** Designed with a focus on long-term investment strategies, ensuring relevance and applicability for investors with varying investment horizons.
- **Object-Oriented Design:** Developed using object-oriented programming principles to enhance readability and maintainability of the codebase.
- **Flexible Input Handling:** Implements comprehensive input validation mechanisms to ensure data integrity, while providing flexibility for users to customise inputs based on their preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Balances robust input validation mechanisms with user flexibility, catering to both novice and experienced users in the financial domain.
- **Demonstration of Financial Knowledge:** Showcases depth of understanding of financial concepts and theories through the implementation of technical analysis and optimisation techniques.
- **Professional Presentation:** Emphasises professionalism in both code structure and documentation, aiming to deliver a high-quality, user-friendly tool for portfolio analysis and optimisation.
